<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

<p>
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
    It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. 
    You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
